"""Pure navigation registry for the Admin Dashboard — no Frappe runtime.

One list, in one place, of every destination the admin panel ships. The
dashboard renders its link directory straight from this registry, so a new
page or doctype appears on the dashboard the moment it is registered here
instead of drifting until someone remembers to hand-edit tile markup. The
tile markup used to BE the registry, which is exactly how the dashboard fell
behind Treasury Funding, Fee Discount, Fygaro Settings and Referral Rewards.

``test_admin_dashboard_nav_contract`` fails the build when a page in
``setup.sync_pages`` or a doctype in the app is missing from ``NAV_GROUPS``
and from ``UNLISTED``, which is what keeps "one place" true.
