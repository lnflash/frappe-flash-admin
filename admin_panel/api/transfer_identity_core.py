"""Pure payer-identity resolution for the Transfer Requests audit tabs.

No frappe or IO imports — everything takes plain dicts (parsed provider
payloads, account identities from mongo_reader, ERPNext Customer rows) so it
can be unit-tested directly, mirroring census_core / bridge_kyc_core.

Field priority (Flash account truth first, provider payload as fallback):
  username — accounts.username, else Fygaro ``customReference``
  name     — ERPNext Customer name (via erpParty), else Fygaro ``client.name``
  email    — ERPNext Customer email_id, else Fygaro ``client.email``
  phone    — mongo users.phone (users.userId == accounts.kratosUserId), else Customer mobile_no

Values that fell back to the provider payload are listed in
``payer_provider_fields`` so the UI can label them "(from provider)" — a
Fygaro ``client`` block is whatever the payer typed at checkout, not verified
Flash identity.
